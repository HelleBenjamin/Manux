Manux
=====
Manux is an open-source, single-tasking and minimalist hobby kernel written in Z80 assembly and C. Currently, the kernel supports basic IO and monotasking, but new features will be added in the future, such as a file system. The kernel is designed to be loadable from BASIC. The kernel is written in a combination of Z80 assembly and C, and can be built with the z88dk toolchain. A minimal kernel can be built with any Z80 assembler, without including the C sources.

System calls
============
Programs can communicate with the kernel using system calls. System calls are implemented in assembly.

The following system calls are implemented:

  0x00 - sys_exit
    BC - exit code

  0x01 - sys_write
    BC - port
    DE - length
    HL - buffer

  0x02 - sys_read
    BC - port
    DE - length
    HL - buffer

  0x03 - sys_gets
    DE - length
    HL - buffer

  0x04 - sys_puts
    DE - length
    HL - buffer

  0x05 - sys_exec
    HL - address

  0x06 - sys_getinfo
    HL - buffer

  0x07 - sys_rand
    HL - buffer

  0x08 - sys_sleep(unimplemented)
    BC - milliseconds

  0x09 - sys_fork

  0x0A - sys_getpid
    HL - buffer

  0x0B - sys_getpcount
    HL - buffer

See `kernel/system_call.asm` for more information

POSIX support
=============
Manux can run very simple POSIX programs. However, it's not fully POSIX-compliant, so it may not work with some programs. Currently the supported features are input/output and fork. 

Minimum system requirements
===========================
- Z80 CPU
- 8K RAM
- 8K ROM (not required if booting from BASIC)
- a serial interface

TODO
====
- Better kernel loader for BASIC
- Rework memory management
- Minimal Z80 assembler(supports only the main instructions)
- More POSIX features
- More documentation

Tips for writing efficient code
===============================
- Use 8-bit and 16-bit variables if possible
- Use preincrement/decrement when possible
- Write simplest code possible
- Use only index registers when required

See z88dk documentation for more information

Pre-requisites
=============
- z88dk (preferably nightly builds)
- make
- kconfig-frontends-nox
- linux

Building
========

To build Manux, run `make`. The kernel is build with z88dk. You need to have z88dk installed to build the kernel.
Use basicloader(bs) to load Manux from BASIC. The bs is tested on BASIC 4.7. Usage example: `./bs 45060 build/MANUX.rom MANUX.bas`
